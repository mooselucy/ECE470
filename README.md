# ECE470: Introduction to Robotics
Project Drunken Bartender

This repository is for the ECE 470 Robotics Project. We decided upon "Drunken Bartender" which will be a robotic bartender that will mix drinks for you. The final details are to be determined, but the robot's main movements is similar to a real bartender. It will be able to shake drinks, identify different bottles (based on ID) and serve patrons.

To be determined, the robot may do tricks for entertainment.

Project 1 Update:
- Implemented robot movement
- Sensor data is obtainable (not used yet)

Project 2 Update:
- Only attempted to implement inverse kinematics in a UR3 robot
- Set up the conveyorbelt and proximity sensor and table.

Project 3 Update:
- Was able to implement forward kinematics as well
- Still working the hand...
- Integrated Matlab into Copellia Sim


Steps to control simulation using MATLAB:

1) Open Robot.ttt using CoppeliaSim
2) Open Robot_movement.m using MATLAB
3) Edit control scripts as desired
